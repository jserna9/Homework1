<p class="ppadding">-Graphic Designer - Web Designer - Photographer-</p>
	<blockquote> <p>Currently a senior at Queens College, with an associates in Design from Nassau Community College. I am to here to persue my love for design, coding and photography.</p>
	<p> Art has always been one of my biggest passions. Ive been coloring since i can remember and when i was little anything i can get my hands on was my canvas. From the walls in my house, to toys, furniture and clothes would be painted as i was grouping up and until this day things dont change.</p>
